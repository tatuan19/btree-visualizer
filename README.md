## About The Project
> A B-Tree visualizer using Java & JavaFX

This is 1 of 3 contents in my OOP project when I was in my third year of university. So I split it into a separate repository so that people can find it more easily.

### Built With

* JavaFX

## Getting Started

1. Get the lastest version of JavaFX (recommended) 
2. If you use Eclipse, you might get an error that can't run the main file. In that case, you can download the JavaFX library in [this site](https://openjfx.io/) & follow as in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVn6_2KuYbM&fbclid=IwAR176uxwT2HMlXVsyGEcThbwOjRKERHRvoNOxMF-t8OnDZd0o0kajEr7Fk4)

## Usage

_See [Introduction of B-Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-b-tree-2/) for more information about B-Tree._
